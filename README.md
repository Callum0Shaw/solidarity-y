# solidarity-y

## A re-build of the wordpress site: https://solidaritynetworky.com/

### Reasons:
- The initial scope of the project keeps increasing beyond a simple blog.
  - As the community grows, they are looking for increased functionality to allow users to engage between themselves.
  - The plugin nature of Wordpress results in a more complicated/convulted site as it expands.
- It is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain and edit the site due to the impromtu way in which it was built.
- As primary maintainer, I am looking to get away from Wordpress and this is one of my larger projects which will continue for the forseeable future.
